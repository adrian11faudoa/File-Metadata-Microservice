# File Metadata Microservice

This is the boilerplate for the File Metadata Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice


1. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

2. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

3. The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.

4. When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.


**HINT**: You can use the **multer** npm package to handle file uploading.
